- Indicators Calculator: Computes technical indicators like RSI, MACD, etc.
- Feature Extractor: Extracts relevant features for decision-making.

**Responsibilities:**
- Prepare raw data for strategy and model inputs.
- Calculate metrics for signal generation.

## 3. Core Strategy Engine: Decision-Making
**Components:**
- Rule-Based Strategies: Predefined logic (e.g., moving averages, RSI thresholds).
- Machine Learning Models: For predictive analytics or classification.
- Risk Management Rules: Stop-loss, take-profit, position sizing.
- Portfolio Optimization: Balance across multiple assets.

**Responsibilities:**
- Analyze data and generate trading signals.
- Incorporate risk management and portfolio objectives.
- Support dynamic adaptation to market conditions.

## 4. Execution Layer: Trade Management
**Components:**
- Order Router: Sends orders to the exchange(s).
- Slippage Manager: Adjusts for expected slippage.
- Position Tracker: Monitors open positions and P&L.
- Error Handler: Detects and recovers from failed orders.

**Responsibilities:**
- Place and manage trades in real-time.
- Minimize execution delays and slippage.
- Ensure compliance with exchange limits and rules.

## 5. Monitoring Layer: Performance and Health
**Components:**
- Live Dashboard: Displays P&L, open positions, and key metrics.
- Alerts System: Notifications for critical events (e.g., large drawdowns).
- Error Logging: Logs errors and anomalies for troubleshooting.
- Analytics Module: Tracks historical performance and strategy effectiveness.

**Responsibilities:**
- Provide visibility into bot operations.
- Alert human operators of issues requiring intervention.

## 6. Backtesting and Simulation Layer
**Components:**
- Backtest Engine: Simulates strategy performance on historical data.
- Simulation Framework: Runs scenarios using real-time data in sandbox mode.
- Metrics Collector: Records key performance indicators (e.g., Sharpe ratio, win rate).

**Responsibilities:**
- Validate strategies before deploying them live.
- Optimize parameters for performance.

## 7. Risk Management Layer
**Components:**
- Position Sizing Module: Allocates capital per trade based on risk appetite.
- Stop-Loss/Take-Profit Automation: Pre-programmed exits for risk control.
- Capital Allocation Manager: Diversifies investment across assets.

**Responsibilities:**
- Protect against large losses.
- Manage leverage and exposure limits.
- Adjust dynamically to market volatility.

## 8. Infrastructure Layer
**Components:**
- Cloud Servers: For scalability and availability.
- Database: Stores historical data, logs, and performance metrics.
- Message Queue: Ensures smooth communication between modules (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka).
- Containerization: Docker/Kubernetes for deployment and scaling.

**Responsibilities:**
- Provide a scalable, fault-tolerant foundation.
- Support efficient data storage and retrieval.

## 9. Security Layer
**Components:**
- API Key Management: Secure storage and use of exchange credentials.
- Encryption: Secure sensitive data and communications.
- Access Control: Limit access to critical systems.
- Fail-Safe Mechanisms: Automatically disable trading in case of anomalies.

**Responsibilities:**
- Prevent unauthorized access.
- Ensure the safety of funds and data.
- Handle contingencies like network outages or exchange downtime.

## 10. Feedback Loop
**Components:**
- Performance Analyzer: Evaluates the success of strategies.
- Learning Module: Updates machine learning models with new data.
- Strategy Tweaker: Refines rules based on market conditions.

**Responsibilities:**
- Continuously improve strategy effectiveness.
- Adapt to changing market dynamics.
